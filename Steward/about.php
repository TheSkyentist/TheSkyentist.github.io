									As a child, my favorite VHS was a 1997
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pypDWDTdiy4" target="_blank">Eyewitness Documentary</a> about the planets.
									Ever since then I couldn't stop wondering what lay beyond earth. The universe intrigued me and I wanted to continue learning about it. 
									I therefore studied physics and mathematics throughout middle and high school, which gave my immediate family and friends the idea that
									I would excel at, or at the very least be interested in, engineering. So, in the summer of 2013, I took an engineering course, and I realised
									that it was the allure of discovery and experimentation that drove me to the sciences in the first place. 
									So after arriving at Dartmouth, I got involved with research in the astronomy department. I am now a graduate student at the University of Arizona and thus far the study of astronomy, just as in my childhood, has kept me spellbound as I marvel over the
									beauty of the universe.

									I was born in France to an Argentine-American mother and Norwegian father, but I grew up and went to grade school in Washington D.C. 
									I try to stay connected to both sides of my family, despite them being on opposite sides of an ocean and the equator, leading me to consume
									copious amounts of airline pretzels. 
									As a person I generally try to keep a positive attitude, however that does come with the added clause of consistently making
									bad puns, to the general dissatisfaction of my friends. I fence épée with the University of Arizona Wildcat Fencing Team (<a href="https://rec.arizona.edu/sport-clubs/fencing-0" target="_blank">Wildcat Fencing</a>) and love to hike and bike in the Tucson area. In my spare time I follow educational 
									channels and gaming channels on youtube, along with a hugely varied number of television shows, ranging from Voltron: Legendary Defender to Westworld.
									I also play some video games, mainly through Steam, that tend to be short, story driven, indie titles. However, I will never turn down a 
									good game of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

									I was born in France to an Argentine mother and Norwegian father, but I grew up and went to grade school in Washington D.C. 
									I try to stay connected to both sides of my family, despite them being on opposite sides of an ocean and the equator. Perhaps
									because of this I find it very easy to adapt to new living conditions (which makes it easier when Dartmouth makes us reapply for housing
									every few months) but conversely it can be rather hard to choose one place that I associate with home or a real feeling of constancy.
									Wherever my wifi connects automatically is all I need for a home!

									As a person I generally try to keep a positive attitude, however that does come with the added clause of consistently making
									bad puns, to the general dissatisfaction of my friends. I am a nationally rated B14 épéeist, and I fence with the Dartmouth
									College Fencing Club (<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~fencing/" target="_blank">DCFC</a>). The team is an immense source of
									comfort and support for me, owing mainly to the fact that we are one huge family that cares and looks out for each other.
									I try to spend as much time as I can with my good friends, and I place a lot of value in those relationships that I believe (and hope) will
									carry on throughout my life. I am also a member of Alpha Theta Gender-inclusive Fraternity on campus. In my spare time I follow educational 
									channels and gaming channels on youtube, along with a hugely varied number of television shows, ranging from BBC's Doctor Who to Fox's New Girl.
									I also play some video games, mainly through Steam, that tend to be short, story driven, indie titles. However, I will never turn down a 
									good game of Super Smash Bros. Melee.
