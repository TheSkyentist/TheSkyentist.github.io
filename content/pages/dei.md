Title: Diversity Equity & Inclusion
Slug: dei

Astronomy has never been an equal playing field, and the field continues to suffer from a lack of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and opinions. Without direct and concerted efforts, these structural barriers cannot be torn down. I continue to work within my academic departments and systems to achieve equity for the future generations of astronomers.

Currently my DEI efforts are centered around Astrocharlas, the first dedicated Spanish-language public talk series in the College of Science at UArizona. By partnering with Spanish speaking undergraduates we hope to foster academic and cultural relationships among Spanish-speaking and Latinx astronomers. We provide opportunities including meeting academics from around the world and conference travel to ensure the success of Astrocharlas students in whatever discipline they hope to pursue.

## Astrocharlas

In order to affect systematic change in astronomy, I was the primary organizer for Astrocharlas, a program which provides spanish-speaking undergraduates with experience and a professional network. Once a semester we host a Spanish-language talk on astronomy topics with speakers from around the world. Astrocharlas is the first dedicated Spanish-language talk series at the College of Science at UArizona. Please find out more about this program at the [HSI Astrocharlas page](https://hsi.arizona.edu/astrocharlas-0).
