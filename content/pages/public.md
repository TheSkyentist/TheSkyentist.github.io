As much as I love learning, it is important to me to pass on my passion and knowledge in astronomy. Public outreach in the sciences is incredibly important to draw attention to the important work that goes on all over the world in frontier astronomical research, and to encourage the new generation of astronomers to begin learning the subject at any age. I have strived to work across environments, on top of mountains and in cities, across age groups, from schoolchildren to senior citizens, and even internationally in order to bring astronomy to all members of the public. Find a selection of my public outreach work below.

If you would like me to give a public talk at your school or organization, please feel free to contact me with the form [here](#contact).
