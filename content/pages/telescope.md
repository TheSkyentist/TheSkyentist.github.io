Ever since learning about telescopes and instrumentation, I have wanted to eventually embark on the task of creating my own scope. I aim to create a dobsonian telescope even including an equatorial tracking platform. I have since begun to craft my mirror.

In addition, I have a f/5 150mm reflector that I use for my own viewing pleasure and to take very basic astrophotography. I work with friends in order to hopefully add to the wealth of beautiful astronomical photos present in the world.

## Current Project

I am currently working on a 200mm f/6 dobsonian telescope with the aid of the Springfield Telescope Makers Club and the [National Capital Astronomers](http://capitalastronomers.org/) at the Chevy Chase Community Center. You can learn more about dobsonian telescope making [here](https://stellafane.org/tm/dob/index.php).
